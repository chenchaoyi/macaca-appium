# Introduction ##
#### A brief introduction of how to use [Macaca](macacajs.github.io/macaca/) to run [Appium](http://appium.io/) test

Appium has been around for 5 years, yet I couldn't find any alternative solution until Macaca was introduced last year. 

This repo provides simple instructions on setup Macaca locally to run your existed Appium tests.

## Why ##
* The Automation instrument has been removed from Instruments since Xcode 8 beta 2. While Appium still struggles to migrate to use XCUItest underlayer, Macaca has already done the switch.

* Macaca supports multiple selenium sessions in single test.

The following instruction is for **iOS**.

## Installation ##
* Install [Node.js >= v0.12.x and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
* Create a new folder:
```bash
$ mkdir macaca-tryout
$ cd macaca-tryout
```
* Install macaca client:
```bash
$ npm install macaca-cli
```
* Install macaca iOS driver
```bash
$ npm install macaca-ios
```

And that's it, all setup is done.

## Usage ##

* Start macaca server on Appium server port:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/macaca server --verbose -p 4723
```

* Now you can run your Appium test just as it is, Macaca server replaces Appium server, and you are all set to see your tests running with XCUItest instead of the deprecated UIAutomator underlayer.

## Inspector ##
Macaca provides a [Web based inspector]
(macacajs.github.io/macaca/inspector.html) for you to locate App elements,
just like the Appium UI inspector.

To try it out:

* Create a new folder:
```bash
$ mkdir macaca-inspector
$ cd macaca-inspector
```
* Install macaca client (I don't recommend to install it globally):
```bash
$ npm install app-inspector
```
* Use it (for iOS)
```bash
# Get the UDID of your simulator
$ xcrun simctl list
# Start your selected simulator
$ open -a Simulator --args -CurrentDeviceUDID "${this.deviceId}"
# Start Macaca inspector, then point your browser to the address as showed in the terminal
$ ./node_modules/.bin/app-inspector -u "${this.deviceId}"
```
